# Tcsh Shell
This is an interactive program.
Repeatedly prints a prompt and reads the whole line from user.
Then the line is split into its components.
If the first component is tcsh's "set", "echo", "alias", or "exit", the program obeys the command.
Otherwise fork and exec are used to make it happen; wait is used for subprocess not terminated.
If exit code is not zero, a warning exit code is printed.
The program also limitedly obeys symbols

     from a file, e.g. a.out < inputs.txt
   > is used to redirect a program's standard output so that it goes
     into a file, e.g. a.out > results
   | is used to pipe the standard output of one program into the standard
     input of another, e.g. a.out | wc
